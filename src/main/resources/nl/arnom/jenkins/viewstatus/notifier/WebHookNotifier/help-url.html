<p><pre>{
  "view": {
    "name": "MyView",
    "display_name": "My View",
    "url": "http://localhost:8080/view/MyView/"
  },
  "result": {
    "text": "SUCCESS",
    "numeric": 0
  },
  "old_result": {
    "text": "FAILURE",
    "numeric": 2
  },
  "startup": false
}</pre></p>
<p>Note that <code>old_result</code> is optional and might not be included. During the start up phase of Jenkins CI the
current status is determined. If the web hook is called because of this <code>startup</code> will be set
to <code>true</code>.</p>
